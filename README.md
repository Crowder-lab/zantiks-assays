# Zantiks MWP Scripts

## Info

These assay and asset generation scripts were originally created for the Zantiks MWP machine used by the Crowder Lab at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. If you are a part of the Crowder Lab, more information can be found in the "Zantiks Assays Explained" presentation in the Google Drive. 6 types of assays are currently supported:

1. Light Dark Preference
2. Light Dark Transition
3. Startle Response
4. Y-Maze
5. Mirror Biting
6. Social Preference

## Editing

If you are not editing these scripts through the Zantiks web interface and would like syntax highlighting, [tree-sitter-zanscript](https://github.com/evdunbar/tree-sitter-zanscript) is available.
